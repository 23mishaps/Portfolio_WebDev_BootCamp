<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Elemental</h3>
<p>This movie is so beautiful. The colors compliment eachother perfectly, and 
    the story line is captivatingly emotional. There were a few times 
    though out the movie that I wanted to cry, but in a good way. 
</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Spiried away is one of my all time favorite movies. I first watched Spirted 
    Away when I was just a little girl, and no matter how many times I watch it, 
    it never gets old. It is a timeless movies.

<h3>In This Corner of the World</h3>
<p>
    In This Corner of the World is a slice of life animated film that takes
    place in Japan during WWII. The story follows a young girl as she 
    enters an arranged marriage and adapts to her new family and their way
    of life. The end is unbareably sad, but the movie in total is a great watch.
