<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a part time college student majoring in computer science. I have some experience with python, Java, HTML
    and CSS. Out of the above listed languages, I am most fluent with Java, and I am working towards 
    completing the first java certification.   I aspire to work for a software development company, but I dream of working in the video game industry.
    I am also an intern and volunteer with a marine science organization where I enter beach survey data sheets into an excel workbook and maintain
    those digital records. I thuroughly enjoy helping this organization digitalize collected records and would like
    to continue this work by helping other organizations with limited resources keep digital records.
